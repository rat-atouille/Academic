# Introduction to Software Engineering 2024 Winter Term
This course on software engineering focuses on applying engineering principles to develop and maintain large software projects effectively. It covers stages like requirements gathering, specification, design, implementation, and testing, along with practical tools and technologies. Through a group project in Java, students gain hands-on experience in a realistic work environment.

## About Our Project
The course project involved creating an educational game centered on a word chain with North American cities and provinces/states. The professor specified mandatory functionalities, and our group added extra features to enhance the gameplay. We utilized Java for implementation, and this directory includes documents, an executable JAR file, codes, unit tests, and JavaDoc. My primary focus was on GUI/frontend development, although I also contributed to the GamePlay.java and resolved backend errors. We managed the project using Agile methodology, holding weekly group meetings to track progress and manage tasks.
